# USB Forensic Investigation

## Overview
This repository documents a USB forensic investigation conducted to analyze removable media artifacts, validate evidence integrity, and assess potential security impact. The investigation focused on identifying USB device usage, examining files stored on removable media, and correlating forensic artifacts to determine whether malicious or unauthorized activity was present.

This project demonstrates hands-on digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) techniques commonly used in SOC and investigative environments when handling removable media events.

## Investigation Focus
- Identification of USB device connection artifacts
- Analysis of files stored on removable media
- Cryptographic hash validation to ensure evidence integrity
- Correlation of file system metadata and timestamps
- Assessment of potential security or policy implications

## Tools and Techniques
- FTK Imager
- Windows Registry analysis
- NTFS file system examination
- MD5 and SHA-1 hash verification
- Forensic artifact correlation
